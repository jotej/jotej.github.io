“We discover the structure of the world by observing it, not by being told the name of every object.” — *Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio & Geoffrey Hinton*, **Nature** (2015)

Labels are a lossy projection of reality. They are representations of the world filtered through a semantic lens. That lens can simplify what is seen, but it can also discard nuance and structure that may be essential for understanding.

A familiar example is social memory. We often store others as a face and a feeling. That shortcut works surprisingly well, but it comes at a cost. We are complex and change with context. Meeting someone on a bad day can leave a lasting impression, even if it says little about who they are most of the time.
